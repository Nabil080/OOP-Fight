# OopFight

A simple PHP battle simulator — my second PHP project and first time using classes (OOP).

##

This project simulates a turn-based fight between two characters with randomized stats and class-based abilities.
Each time you reload the page, the outcome may change — for example:
- A **FireMage** can burn the opponent over time.
- A **Farmer** has a chance to land critical hits.

## Usage

```bash
php -S localhost:8000
```

Then visit: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)


## Concepts Learned
### New Concepts
- Object-Oriented Programming (classes, properties, methods)

### Other Concepts
- Randomization and probabilities
- Basic algorithms and combat logic

## Screenshots

- Fighting back and forth (first player is random)
